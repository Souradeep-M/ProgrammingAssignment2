## The functions create an inverse of a matrix using a caching method in order
## to avoid performing computations that are intensive multiple times. To 
## accomplish, a caching method performs the inverse once and then uses
## the cached inverted matrix for future calls.

## makeCacheMatrix creates a list of four functions that:
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of inverse of the matrix
## get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinv = setinv,
       getinv = getinv)
}


## Compute the inverse of the special matrix returned by "makeCacheMatrix"
## above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not
## changed), then the "cachesolve" should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
}
